CIWOG INSTALLATION
-------------------
CIWOG is a collection of perl scripts, which detect common introns, provide web interfaces and 
database interaction, and javascript/html files.
CIWOG has the following directories:
	conf
	cgi
	html
	scripts
	input
	output


The cgi directory needs to be handled as CGI scripts by your apache 
webserver.  The html directory needs to be handled as static files by 
your apache webserver.  One way to achieve this is to edit your apache 
configuration file.  This method will be described below. (Alternatively, one 
could move the directories into the default CGI and html directories on your 
machine.)


0.  Confirm you have the requirements listed in the requirements section.

1. cd to the directory where you would like to install CIWOG.

	% cd /
or
	% cd /usr/local/src

2. unpack the archive:

	% tar -zxvf ciwog.tgz

3. Change ownership of tmp directory to apache.  This directory will contain 
evidence plot images of the Annotation Tool.
	
	% mkdir ciwog/html/tmp
	% chown apache ciwog/html/tmp

4. Edit the apache configuration file.

	Append the following to your httpd.conf file (this is often located at 
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf):


 # CIWOG
  Alias /ciwog "/ciwog/html/"
  ScriptAlias /ciwog-cgi "/ciwog/cgi/"
  <LocationMatch "/ciwog-cgi">
      SetEnv PERL5LIB .:/ciwog/conf:/ciwog/cgi
  </LocationMatch>


Note:
The aliases can be prefixed with an additional path for the URL or for the 
local CIWOG directory on your machine.  This readme presents an example for a 
directory installed at /ciwog/ on your machine, that is accessed with URLs of 
the form http://localhost/CIWOG.  You can change either of these paths to your 
liking.

For example, if CIWOG was located at /usr/local/src/ the apache configuration 
file would be:
 # CIWOG
  Alias /ciwog "/usr/local/src/ciwog/html/"
  ScriptAlias /ciwog-cgi "/usr/local/src/CIWOG/cgi/"
  <LocationMatch "/ciwog-cgi">
      SetEnv PERL5LIB .:/usr/local/src/ciwog/conf:/usr/local/src/ciwog/scripts
  </LocationMatch>


DATABASE SETUP
--------------------------------
CIWOG stores annotation and user information in a MySQL database.
This procedure describes how to set up this database.  


1. Create database. (You will probably need to be root.)
	% mysql -u root -p
	mysql> create database ciwog;

2. Add a user with full priveledges to the database. This can be 'ciwogUser' 
or something different.

	mysql> grant all on ciwog.* to ciwogUser@localhost;
	mysql> exit;

3. Load the CIWOG schema.
	% mysql -u root -p ciwog < ciwog/ciwog.sql





CONFIGURING CIWOG
------------------
The conf directory contains the configuration file for CIWOG.  
An functional example file is given as conf/conf.pl.
This file is required for ciwog functionality.  This file contains
directory paths for ciwog input and database connectivity.
This file contains labels for each variable.  If you have followed
this INSTALL documentation, no edits to this file are necessary.


PROCESS DATA
------------
1. Optionally, populate the input directory with a directory for each
 gene cluster.  Within the directory, name the gene information file 
with the cluster's  name and name the protein alignment cluster.aln
This software comes with two example clusters and if you do not want 
to use your own data, then you do not need to edit anything.


2. Optionally, edit the CIDA options (maxSlide, maxGap, simRegion,
 minSim, minAbsentSim) in the file scripts/run_ciwog.pl  These options
are set to the loose version as described in the manuscript.  See the
manuscript for further details.

3. Run CIWOG
perl -I../conf run_ciwog.pl


VIEW YOUR DATA WITH CIWOG WEB DISPLAYS
--------------
Using a web browser, go to: http://localhost/ciwog-cgi/home.pl.
